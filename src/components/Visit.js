            <p>Great educational visionaries like late P.V.Narasimha Rao and the then educational Secretary Sri M.V.Raja Gopal were instrumental in seeding the GURUKULAM â€“ SYSTEM of education in Andhra Pradesh.<br></br><br></br>

            This traditional style of education started with three RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS and later three RESIDENTIAL JUNIOR COLLEGES. The tremendous success of these institutions paved a way to start a RESIDENTIAL DEGREE COLLEGE for UG level students at Nagarjuna Sagar, Guntur(Dt). The A.P.R.DEGREE COLLEGE was started in 1982 under APREI Society (GO.MS.No.762 Edu. Dated:02-09-1982) to provide quality education for the rural talented boys coming from economically disadvantaged sections. The institution is providing quality instructions in basic sciences and Humanities to the students.<br></br><br></br>

            The foundation was laid very strongly by inducting very eminent and experienced Principals and teaching staff from various organizations with at least 2 decades of experience.<br></br><br></br>

            The highly experienced principals like Late Sri P.S.RamaChandra Rao garu, Dr.J.Murali Mohan garu, Sri.Y.V.Reddy garu etc. have guided the institution in to a center of excellence with the assistance and help of around 30 of eminent teaching staff. This has paved the way of the production of humber of CIVIL SERVENTS, INDUSTRIALISTS, SCIENTISTS, CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS etc. in country. The students are selected from a state level entrance test duly following the merit and reservations as per Govt.rules. The college is since there catering to the needs of rural talented and meritorious students.</p>
