        <p>The traditional ‘GURUKUL’ style of education, in which both the teacher and taught lived together under the same roof, is now translated into the modern residential institution. The Residential Institutions (Schools, Junior Colleges, and one Degree College) are aimed at imparting quality, value based education to the bright, aspiring, especially rural/socially deprived students of all the three regions of the State of Andhra Pradesh, thanks to the vision and forethought of the then chief minister Sri P.V.Narasimha Rao and administrators like Sri M.V.Rajagopal, IAS (Retd.).<br></br><br></br>

        The stupendous success of these institutions encouraged the government to start the A.P. Residential Degree College, in the year 1982 in Nagarjunasagar, Guntru District, under the A.P.Residential Educational Institutions Society(R), Hyderabad<br></br><br></br>

        The college has been serving the student’s community of the entire Andhra Pradesh and Telangana especially the rural/socially deprived for the past 38Years. Students of this institution are selected on the basis of merit through a State Wide Entrance Test.</p>
