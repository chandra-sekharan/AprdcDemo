<b>UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE RESIDENTIAL SYSTEM WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO A.P.R.D.C</b><br></br><br></br>

1) The students of A.P.R.D.C are remarkable not only for their academic and professional achievements but also for their sense of social responsibility and commitment to duty.<br></br><br></br>

<b>The success of the institution is due to:</b><br></br><br></br>

The pillars and foundations for any educational institutions is its teaching faculty.
