        <p>Most academicians and industry front liners are on the same page when it comes to collaboration. Industrial collaboration improves the relationship between theory and applicability of it, it enriches the knowledge of students  and their employability.<br></br><br></br>

          In view of these things our college also made MOUâ€™s with Industries like Software, Commerce and English and Foreign Language University to enrich the  communication and software  skills.</p>
