        <p>Since our college is located in the Nagarjunasagar dam area, fluoride content in water is higher than the required amount and calcium content is lesser than the required quantity to the human body.<br></br><br></br>

           RO Water purifier is the most effective way of removing the heavy metals and chemicals like iron, lead , mercury, arsenic, chlorine and fluoride.<br></br><br></br>

           All the physical contaminations, microorganisms are also filtered by RO Purifier which makes water 100% unadulterated for consumption. RO Water Plant is installed in the hostel to keep the students away from water related diseases. Alumni donated RO Water Purifier to provide purified water to the students.</p>
